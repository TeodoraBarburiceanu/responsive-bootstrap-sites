                                Porsche Engineering Romania SRL, located in Cluj-Napoca, specializes in software and function development, while remaining 
                                closely linked with overall vehicle development, including simulation and construction.The Porsche Engineering corporate film showcases
                                the company as an innovative engineering services provider for future-oriented mobility. Special attention is paid to employees and their
                                engineering competence who resolve clients' challenges with new and unconventional ideas. And that well beyond the automotive industry. 
                                The founding of the design office by Ferdinand Porsche in 1931 was the origin of Porsche's engineering services for customers. Ever since then,
                                Porsche has been providing engineering services to customers from a wide range of industries.

                            <p>
                                Since Porsche Engineering opened in Cluj, we have established a close collaboration with the Technical University Cluj-Napoca. The first step of
                                the company's development was partnering with the university's automotive engineering faculty. In autumn of 2017 we started the Porsche engineering
                                master's program, in which the university's top 20 engineering students are currently enrolled. We offered 11 master's thesis topics based on allocation
                                interviews. Furthermore, five scholarships at bachelor level and 10 Porsche Engineering scholarships for the master's program are offered to students with
                                outstanding technical and soft skills.Also, Porsche Engineering Romania offers annual summer internships in different company departments. Students can assist
                                employees in various tasks and gain a first impression of what their own future career might be like.

                                Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle 
                                everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.Git allows and
                                encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each 
                                other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

                            <p>
                                At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and
                                manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. Essentially, it makes it 
                                a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.

                               Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate
                               all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

                                Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your
                                applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure
                                in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying 
                                code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
