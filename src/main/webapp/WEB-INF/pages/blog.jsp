                            <p>
                                Since Porsche Engineering opened in Cluj, we have established a close collaboration with the Technical University Cluj-Napoca. The first step of
                                the company’s development was partnering with the university’s automotive engineering faculty. In autumn of 2017 we started the Porsche engineering
                                master’s program, in which the university’s top 20 engineering students are currently enrolled. We offered 11 master’s thesis topics based on allocation
                                interviews. Furthermore, five scholarships at bachelor level and 10 Porsche Engineering scholarships for the master’s program are offered to students with
                                outstanding technical and soft skills.Also ,orsche Engineering Romania offers annual summer internships in different company departments. Students can assist
                                employees in various tasks and gain a first impression of what their own future career might be like.
